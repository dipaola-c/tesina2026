> > Bandoneon! is a combine incorporating programmed audio circuits, moving loudspeakers, TV images, and lighting instrumentally excited. . . . Bandoneon! uses no composing means, since when activated it composes itself out of its own composite instrumental nature [1]. The term “combine” is significant, for Bandoneon! is not quite a composition in the traditional sense. Tudor does not claim the role of composer; rather, he is interpreter and performer acting within an interactive situation created collaboratively. The idea that a piece can “compose itself” is best understood by considering the development of Tudor’s self-conception as a pianist and his approach to the indeterminate compositions with which he was most closely associated.

Bandoneon! no utiliza ningún medio de composición, ya que cuando se activa se compone a sí mismo a partir de su propia naturaleza instrumental compuesta

> > Tudor tended to take any technological paradigm or device that interested him and attempt to invert its terms. Rainforest typifies this. Loudspeakers are prized for their ability to produce all possible sounds, while the concept of Rainforest is that loudspeakers should have their own voice. In Tudor’s description of the idea: It came about because of a sudden idea which occurred to me one day: that one didn’t have to think of the generation of electronic music from signal source to the reproducing output, but one, instead, might just as well start from the other end and go back and arrive at a signal source [23].
